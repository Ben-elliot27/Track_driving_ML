# Track_driving_ML
### NOTE: NOT FINISHED OR WORKING
An arcade project to train a NN on a driving game.

#### AIM:
A project to run a python game, then use this to train a NN to play the game, hopefully trained via Q-learning. 
Currently has scripts containing torch NNs, however would like to swap these for tensorflow NNs.

#### CURRENT PROGRESS:
'Game.py' arcade script works to load and run the game with human inputs from the keyboard,
however the machine learning scripts are not working.
